# Vulnerability Assessment Report – Passive Security Audit

## Overview

This repository contains a professional **Passive Vulnerability Assessment Report** conducted against a publicly accessible web application.

The objective of this assessment was to evaluate the external security posture of the target system using **non-intrusive, read-only techniques** aligned with ethical cybersecurity practices.

No exploitation or active attacks were performed during this assessment.

This project demonstrates practical skills in:

• Security analysis  
• Risk identification  
• Business-focused reporting  
• Ethical testing methodology  
• Vulnerability documentation

## Target Application

**Website:** http://demo.testfire.net/index.jsp  
**Domain:** demo.testfire.net  

This application is a deliberately vulnerable online banking demo environment designed for security training and educational purposes.

## Assessment Scope

### ✔ In Scope
- Public-facing web pages  
- Passive vulnerability scanning  
- Security header inspection  
- Service exposure analysis  
- Client-side configuration review  

### ❌ Out of Scope
- Exploitation attempts  
- Brute force attacks  
- Authentication bypass  
- Malware injection  
- Denial-of-Service testing  
- Any disruptive activity  

This approach mirrors real-world preliminary security audits frequently performed before full penetration testing engagements.

---

## Methodology

The assessment followed a structured consulting-style methodology:

1. External Reconnaissance  
2. Attack Surface Mapping  
3. Passive Vulnerability Identification  
4. Security Header Evaluation  
5. Configuration Review  
6. Risk Classification  
7. Remediation Planning  

The goal was to identify weaknesses that could increase organizational risk while maintaining strict ethical boundaries.

## Tools Utilized

### 🔹 Nmap
Used for external network discovery and service enumeration to identify exposed ports and potential entry points.

### 🔹 OWASP ZAP (Passive Scan)
Performed automated passive analysis to detect security misconfigurations without interacting aggressively with the application.

### 🔹 Browser Developer Tools
Used to inspect HTTP security headers, cookies, and client-side protections.

### 🔹 Manual Review
Supplemented automated tools with human-driven inspection to improve contextual accuracy.

## Key Outcomes

The assessment focuses on:

- Identifying security misconfigurations  
- Highlighting missing protective controls  
- Explaining risk in business-friendly language  
- Providing practical remediation guidance  

The report is structured to resemble deliverables produced by professional security consulting firms.

## Ethical Statement

This assessment was conducted strictly within passive boundaries.

No techniques were used that could degrade service availability, compromise data integrity, or impact system performance.

The target environment is publicly available for security testing practice.

---

## Why This Project Matters

Modern organizations rely heavily on web applications, yet security misconfigurations often go unnoticed until exploited.

Proactive vulnerability assessments help organizations:

- Reduce attack surface  
- Strengthen defensive posture  
- Prioritize remediation  
- Improve resilience  

This project reflects a real-world security consulting mindset rather than a purely academic exercise.

---

## Disclaimer

This assessment was limited to passive testing techniques.  
Active exploitation was intentionally excluded; therefore, additional vulnerabilities may exist that would require controlled penetration testing to identify.
